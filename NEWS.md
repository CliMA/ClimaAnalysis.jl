ClimaAnalysis.jl Release Notes
===============================

v0.5.9
------

## Features

### Reorder dimensions
Before, resampling requires that the order of the dimensions is the same between the two
`OutputVar`s. This feature adds the functionality of reordering the dimensions in a
`OutputVar` to match the ordering of another `OutputVar`. The function `resampled_as` is
updated to use `reordered_as`. See the example below of this functionality.

```julia
julia> src_var.dims |> keys |> collect
2-element Vector{String}:
 "long"
 "lat"

julia> dest_var.dims |> keys |> collect
2-element Vector{String}:
 "lat"
 "long"

julia> reordered_var = ClimaAnalysis.reordered_as(src_var, dest_var);

julia> reordered_var.dims |> keys |> collect
2-element Vector{String}:
 "lat"
 "long"
```

## Bug fixes

- Fix models repeating in legend of box plots by not considering the models in `model_names`
  when finding the best and worst models
- Fix legend from covering the box plot by adding the parameter `legend_text_width` which
  control the number of characters on each line of the legend of the box plot
- Use default marker size instead of a marker size of 20 when plotting other models beside
  `CliMA` on the box plot

### Add support for directly reading NetCDF files

Starting version 0.5.8, `ClimaAnalysis` now supports NetCDF files that were not
generated with
[`ClimaDiagnostics`](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaDiagnostics.jl) [0].

To load a `NetCDF` file into a `ClimaAnalysis.OutputVar`, just pass the path of
such file to the constructor
```julia
import ClimaAnalysis: OutputVar

myfile = OutputVar("my_netcdf_file.nc")
```
`ClimaAnalysis` will try to find a variable in this file. If multiple are available,
`ClimaAnalysis` picks the latest in alphabetical order. If you want to specify one,
pass it to the constructor:
```julia
import ClimaAnalysis: OutputVar

myfile = OutputVar("my_netcdf_file.nc", "myvar")
```

[0] Restrictions apply.

### Resampling a `OutputVar` using the dimensions from another `OutputVar`

You can use the `resampled_as(src_var, dest_var)` function where `src_var` is a
OutputVar with the data you want to resample using the dimensions in another
OutputVar `dest_var`. If resampling is possible, then a new `OutputVar` is
returned where the data in `src_var` is resampled using a linear interpolation
to fit the dimensions in `dest_var`. Resampling is not possible when the
dimensions in either `OutputVar`s are missing units, the dimensions between the
`OutputVar`s do not agree, or the data in `src_var` is not defined everywhere on
the dimensions in `dest_var`.

```julia
julia> src_var.data
3×4 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  4.0  7.0  10.0
 2.0  5.0  8.0  11.0
 3.0  6.0  9.0  12.0

julia> src_var.dims
OrderedDict{String, Vector{Float64}} with 2 entries:
  "lon"      => [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
  "latitude" => [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

julia> dest_var.dims # dims that src_var.data should be resampled on
OrderedDict{String, Vector{Float64}} with 2 entries:
  "long" => [0.0, 1.0]
  "lat"  => [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]

julia> resampled_var = ClimaAnalysis.resampled_as(src_var, dest_var);

julia> resampled_var.data
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  4.0  7.0
 2.0  5.0  8.0

julia> resampled_var.dims # updated dims that are the same as the dims in dest_var
OrderedDict{String, Vector{Float64}} with 2 entries:
  "lon"      => [0.0, 1.0]
  "latitude" => [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
```

### Add support for converting units

`ClimaAnalysis` now uses
[Unitful](https://painterqubits.github.io/Unitful.jl/stable) to handle variable
units, when possible.

When a `OutputVar` has `units` among its `attributes`, `ClimaAnalysis` will try
to use `Unitful` to parse it. If successful, `OutputVar` can be directly
converted to other compatible units. For example, if `var` has units of `m/s`,
```julia-repl
julia> ClimaAnalysis.convert_units(var, "cm/s")
```
will convert to `cm/s`.

Some units are not recognized by `Unitful`. Please, open an issue about that:
we can add more units.

In those cases, or when units are incompatible, you can also pass a
`conversion_function` that specify how to transform units.
```julia-repl
julia> ClimaAnalysis.convert_units(var, "kg/s", conversion_function = (x) - 1000x)
```

### Applying a land/sea mask to `GeoMakie` plots

When plotting with `GeoMakie` (ie, using the `contour2D_on_globe!` and
`heatmap2D_on_globe!` function), it is now possible to mask out a portion of the
output. The most common use cases are to hide the ocean or the continents.

To hide the ocean, you can now pass `mask = ClimaAnalysis.Visualize.oceanmask()`
to the globe plotting functions. You can customize how the mask is plotted by
passing the `:mask` extra keywords. For example:
```julia
import ClimaAnalysis.Visualize: contour2D_on_globe!, oceanmask
import ClimaAnalysis.Utils: kwargs as ca_kwargs
import GeoMakie
import CairoMakie

fig = CairoMakie.Figure()

contour2D_on_globe!(fig,
                    var,
                    mask = oceanmask(),
                    more_kwargs = Dict(:mask => ca_kwargs(color = :blue)),
                   )

CairoMakie.save("myfigure.pdf", fig)
```

### Integrating `OutputVar` with respect to longitude or latitude

You can use the `integrate_lon(var)`, `integrate_lat(var)`, or `integrate_lonlat(var)`
functions for integrating along longitude, latitude, or both respectively. The bounds of
integration are determined by the range of the dimensions longitude and latitude in `var`.
The unit of both longitude and latitude should be degree.

If the points are equispaced, it is assumed that each point correspond to the midpoint of a
cell which results in rectangular integration using the midpoint rule. Otherwise, the
integration being done is rectangular integration using the left endpoints for integrating
longitude and latitude. See the example of integrating over a sphere where the data is all
ones to find the surface area of a sphere.

```julia
julia> lon = collect(range(-179.5, 179.5, 360));

julia> lat = collect(range(-89.5, 89.5, 180));

julia> data = ones(length(lon), length(lat));

julia> dims = OrderedDict(["lon" => lon, "lat" => lat]);

julia> dim_attribs = OrderedDict([
           "lon" => Dict("units" => "degrees_east"),
           "lat" => Dict("units" => "degrees_north"),
       ]);

julia> attribs = Dict("long_name" => "f");

julia> var = ClimaAnalysis.OutputVar(attribs, dims, dim_attribs, data);

julia> integrated_var = integrate_lonlat(var);

julia> integrated_var.dims # no dimensions since longitude and latitude are integrated out
OrderedDict{String, Vector{Float64}}()

julia> integrated_var.data # approximately 4π (the surface area of a sphere)
0-dimensional Array{Float64, 0}:
12.566530113084296

julia> long_name(integrated_var) # updated long name to reflect the data being integrated
"f integrated over lon (-179.5 to 179.5degrees_east) and integrated over lat (-89.5 to 89.5degrees_north)"
```

### Splitting OutputVar by season
`OutputVar`s can be split by seasons using `split_by_season(var)` provided that a start date
can be found in `var.attributes["start_date"]` and time is a dimension in the `OutputVar`.
The unit of time is expected to be second. The function `split_by_season(var)` returns a
vector of four `OutputVar`s with each `OutputVar` corresponding to a season. The months of
the seasons are March to May, June to August, September to November, and December to
February. The order of the vector is MAM, JJA, SON, and DJF. If there are no dates found for
a season, then the `OutputVar` for that season will be an empty `OutputVar`.

```julia
julia> attribs = Dict("start_date" => "2024-1-1");

julia> time = [0.0, 5_184_000.0, 13_132_800.0]; # correspond to dates 2024-1-1, 2024-3-1, 2024-6-1

julia> dims = OrderedDict(["time" => time]);

julia> dim_attribs = OrderedDict(["time" => Dict("units" => "s")]); # unit is second

julia> data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0];

julia> var = ClimaAnalysis.OutputVar(attribs, dims, dim_attribs, data);

julia> MAM, JJA, SON, DJF = ClimaAnalysis.split_by_season(var);

julia> ClimaAnalysis.isempty(SON) # empty OutputVar because no dates between September to November
true

julia> [MAM.dims["time"], JJA.dims["time"], DJF.dims["time"]]
3-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [5.184e6]
 [1.31328e7]
 [0.0]

julia> [MAM.data, JJA.data, DJF.data]
3-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [2.0]
 [3.0]
 [1.0]
```

### Compute bias and squared error between OutputVar
Bias and squared error can be computed from simulation data and observational data in
`OutputVar`s using `bias(sim, obs)` and `squared_error(sim, obs)`. The function `bias(sim,
obs)` returns a `OutputVar` whose data is the bias (`sim.data - obs.data`) and computes the
 global bias of `data` in `sim` and `obs` over longitude and latitude. The result is stored
in `var.attributes["global_bias"]`. The function `squared_error(sim, obs)` returns a
`OutputVar` whose data is the squared error (`(sim.data - obs.data)^2`) and computes the
global mean squared error (MSE) and the global root mean squared error (RMSE) of `data` in
`sim` and `obs` over longitude and latitude. The result is stored in
`var.attributes["global_mse"]` and `var.attributes["global_rmse"]`. Resampling is
automatically done by resampling `obs` on `sim`. If you are only interested in computing
global bias, MSE, or RMSE, you can use `global_bias(sim, obs)`, `global_mse(sim, obs)`, or
`global_rmse(sim, obs)`.

As of now, these functions are implemented for `OutputVar`s with only the dimensions
longitude and latitude. Furthermore, units must be supplied for data and dimensions in `sim`
and `obs` and the units for longitude and latitude should be degrees.

Consider the following example, where we compute the bias and RMSE between our simulation
and some observations stored in "ta\_1d\_average.nc".

```julia
julia> obs_var = OutputVar("ta_1d_average.nc"); # load in observational data

julia> sim_var = get(simdir("simulation_output"), "ta"); # load in simulation data

julia> ClimaAnalysis.short_name(sim_var)
"ta"

julia> bias_var = ClimaAnalysis.bias(sim_var, obs_var); # bias_var is a OutputVar that can be plotted

julia> global_bias(sim, obs)
2.0

julia> units(bias_var)
"K"

julia> se_var = ClimaAnalysis.squared_error(sim_var, obs_var); # can also be plotted

julia> global_mse(sim, obs)
4.0

julia> global_rmse(sim, obs)
2.0

julia> units(se_var)
"K^2"
```

### Plotting bias

Building upon the other features introduced in this release, you can now directly plot bias
and root mean squared error between two variables with the `plot_bias_on_globe!` function.
Typically, this is done to compare simulated data against observations.

In the example below, we plot the bias between our simulation and some observations stored
in `ta_1d_average.nc`.

```julia
import ClimaAnalysis
import ClimaAnalysis.Visualize: plot_bias_on_globe!
import GeoMakie
import CairoMakie

obs_var = ClimaAnalysis.OutputVar("ta_1d_average.nc")
sim_var = ClimaAnalysis.get(ClimaAnalysis.simdir("simulation_output"), "ta")

fig = CairoMakie.Figure()
plot_bias_on_globe!(fig, sim_var, obs_var)
CairoMakie.save("myfigure.pdf", fig)
```

### Represent RMSEs from various models

To facilitate analysis of root mean squared errors (RMSEs) over different models and
categories (e.g., seasons) for a single variable of interest, `RMSEVariable` is introduced in
this release. See the examples below of constructing a `RMSEVariable` using a short name, a
vector of model names, a vector of categories, and a dictionary mapping model names to units
or a string of the name of the unit.

```julia
import ClimaAnalysis

rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.RMSEVariable("ta", ["ACCESS-CM2", "ACCESS-ESM1-5"])
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.RMSEVariable(
    "ta",
    ["ACCESS-CM2", "ACCESS-ESM1-5"],
    Dict("ACCESS-CM2" => "K", "ACCESS-ESM1-5" => "K"),
)
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.RMSEVariable(
    "ta",
    ["ACCESS-CM2", "ACCESS-ESM1-5"],
    ["DJF", "MAM", "JJA", "SON", "ANN"],
    Dict("ACCESS-CM2" => "K", "ACCESS-ESM1-5" => "K"),
)
# Convenience functions if models all share the same unit
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.RMSEVariable(
    "ta",
    ["ACCESS-CM2", "ACCESS-ESM1-5"],
    "K",
)
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.RMSEVariable(
    "ta",
    ["ACCESS-CM2", "ACCESS-ESM1-5"],
    ["DJF", "MAM", "JJA", "SON", "ANN"],
    "K",
)
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.RMSEVariable(
    "ta",
    ["ACCESS-CM2", "ACCESS-ESM1-5"],
    ["DJF", "MAM", "JJA", "SON", "ANN"],
    ones(2, 5),
    "K",
)
```

A `RMSEVariable` can be inspected using `model_names`, `category_names`, and `rmse_units`
which provide the model names, the category names, and the units respectively.

#### Reading RMSEs from CSV file

A CSV file containing model names in the first column and root mean squared errors in the
subsequent columns with a header describing each category (i.e. seasons) can be read into
a `RMSEVariable`. See the example below on how to use this functionality.

```julia
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.read_rmses("./data/test_csv.csv", "ta")
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.read_rmses(
    "./data/test_csv.csv",
    "ta",
    units = Dict("ACCESS-CM2" => "K", "ACCESS-ESM1-5" => "K"), # passing units as a dictionary
)
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.read_rmses(
    "./data/test_csv.csv",
    "ta",
    units = "K", # passing units as a string
)
```

#### Indexing
`RMSEVariable` supports indexing by integer or string. See the example for indexing into
a `RMSEVariable`.

```julia
rmse_var["ACCESS-CM2"]
rmse_var[:, "MAM"]
rmse_var["ACCESS-CM2", ["ANN", "DJF", "MAM"]]
rmse_var[2,5] = 11.2
rmse_var[:, :]
```

#### Adding categories, models, and units
Adding categories (e.g., seasons, months, years, etc.), models, and units to a `RMSEVariable`
can be done using `add_category`, `add_model`, and `add_units!`.

See the example below for how to use this functionality.

```julia
rmse_var2 = ClimaAnalysis.add_category(rmse_var, "Jan") # can take in mode than one category
rmse_var = ClimaAnalysis.add_model(rmse_var, "CliMA") # can take in more than one model name
ClimaAnalysis.add_unit!(rmse_var, "CliMA", "K")
ClimaAnalysis.add_unit!(rmse_var, Dict("CliMA" => "K")) # for adding multiple units
```

#### Summary statistics
Comparsion between models can be done using `find_best_single_model`,
`find_worst_single_model`, and `median`. The functions `find_best_single_model` and
`find_worst_single_model` default to the category "ANN" (corresponding to the annual mean),
but any category be considered using the parameter `category_name`. Furthermore, the model's
root mean squared errors (RMSEs) and name is returned. The function `median` only return the
model's RMSEs. Any `NaN` that appear in the data is ignored when computing the summary
statistics. See the example below on how to use this functionality.

```julia
ClimaAnalysis.find_best_single_model(rmse_var, category_name = "DJF")
ClimaAnalysis.find_worst_single_model(rmse_var, category_name = "DJF")
ClimaAnalysis.median(rmse_var)
```

#### Plotting RMSEVariable
`RMSEVariable` can be visualized as a box plot or heat map using `plot_boxplot!` and
`plot_leaderboard!`. The function `plot_boxplot!` makes a box plot for each category in the
`RMSEVariable` and plots any other models as specified by `model_names`. The function
`plot_leaderboard!` makes a heatmap of the RMSEs between the variables of interest and the
categories. The values of the heatmap are normalized by dividing over the median model's
RMSEs for each variable.

## Bug fixes

- Increased the default value for `warp_string` to 72.
- Binary operation between Real and OutputVar now update the interpolation of the resulting
  OutputVar

## New compat requirements

`ClimaAnalysis` 0.5.8 drops support for versions of `GeoMakie` prior to `0.7.3`.
This change is required to acquire land-sea mask data from `GeoMakie`. Version
`0.7.3` specifically is also required because it fixes a precompilation bug in
`GeoMakie`. As a result, the minimum version of `Makie` is now `0.21.5`.

- `GeoMakie` >= 0.7.3
- `Makie` >= 0.21.5
- `CairoMakie` >= 0.12.0

v0.5.7
------
- Add support for evaluating `OutputVar`s onto arbitrary target points (with
  multilinear interpolation).
- `average` operations now ignore `NaN`s by default.
- Add `has_*` methods to query whether a `Var` has a given dimension (e.g., `z`).
- Support `Makie` backends besides `CairoMakie`.
- Add methods to get the range and units of a given dimension in `Var`.

v0.5.6
------
- Fix finding variables with name like `clwup_1m_40s_inst.nc` (composed period).
- Add support for weighted averages in `average_lat`.

v0.5.5
------
- Fix reading `NetCDF` files with dimensions in incorrect order.

v0.5.4
------
- Added support for extraction dimension from functions, such as `times`.
- Reorganized internal modules so that each file is a module.

v0.5.3
------
- Add `Visualize.contour2D_on_globe!` for discrete contours.
